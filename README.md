# personal-library
RESTful API that allows users to manage their personal libraries.

The API can be accessed by sending requests to the following URLs:

- /api/books/ to get a list of all books
- /api/books/:id to get a specific book by ID
- /api/books/ to create a new book
- /api/books/:id to update a specific book
- /api/books/:id to delete a specific book

The API is implemented using the Express framework and Node.js. The book data is stored in a MongoDB database.
